# site-builder
Platform to build simple template driven websites

### Problem
There is demand for sites that are easy to maintain, but they don't want something as vanilla as Wordpress.

### Solution
This project will provide a slightly more controllable platform to generate sites that look less "cookie cutter" than Wordpress.

### Other Notes
 Mostly this is a project for me to have fun messing around with things that I enjoy.  Potential use may include those who are always asking for websites, but don't need a completely custom solution.
